0
   No charge.
1
   A block -1 and counter-ions.
2
   A block -1 and counter-ions.
   B block +1 and counter-ions.
3
   Half of A block -1 with counter-ions.
4
   Polyanions and polycations. No counterions.
5
   Pure ionized salts.
6
   Multi-block charged polymers. Molecule topology assigned by additional parameters:
      micellePolymerNQ     charge per block
      micelleNIons         number of ions
      micelleIonQ          valence of ions
Q < 0
  Polymers are neutral.
  Q/2 solvents are anions and Q/2 solvents are cations.
